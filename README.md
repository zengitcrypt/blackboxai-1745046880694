# Lotinu Stake - Multi Wallet Connect

## Project Overview
Lotinu Stake is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to connect multiple cryptocurrency wallets and stake their tokens while viewing relevant staking statistics. The application provides a user-friendly interface for staking, rewarding users with real-time data on their investments.

## Installation
To get started with Lotinu Stake, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lotinu-stake.git
   cd lotinu-stake
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in a web browser:**
   The application is designed to run locally in a browser, so opening `index.html` will launch the dApp.

3. **Make sure you have a cryptocurrency wallet installed:**
   Wallets like MetaMask or WalletConnect will be needed to interact with the staking contracts.

## Usage
- **Connect Your Wallet:**
  Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the header to open the wallet selection modal. Choose from supported wallets like MetaMask or WalletConnect.

- **Staking Tokens:**
  - Input the amount you wish to stake in the provided entry field.
  - Click the "Approve" button to allow the spending of tokens by the staking contract.
  - After approval, the button will change to "Stake Now" which allows you to stake your tokens.

- **Claiming Rewards:**
  Once your tokens are staked, you can claim rewards by clicking the "Claim Rewards" button.

- **Emergency Withdraw:**
  If necessary, you can withdraw your tokens by clicking the "Withdraw Tokens" button, which will change to "Emergency Withdraw" if there are restrictions based on the staking contract's rules.

## Features
- **Multiple Wallet Support:** Connect various wallets with a smooth user experience.
- **Real-time Staking Information:** Display of total staked amount, APY, unclaimed treats, and staked tokens.
- **Responsive Design:** The application adapts to different screen sizes for optimal performance on desktop and mobile devices.

## Dependencies
This project does not depend on any external libraries in `package.json`, but it makes use of:
- **Web3.js**: For blockchain interactions.
- **WalletConnect**: For connecting to additional wallets.
- **jQuery**: For DOM manipulation (if it is included).

Make sure to include any dependencies in your local setup if you're extending the functionality.
